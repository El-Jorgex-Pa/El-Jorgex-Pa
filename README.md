# About Me

Hi, my name is Jorge Arango `@El-Jorgex-Pa`, I´m currently studying `Electronic Engineering` at the `National University of Colombia`
while learning `Java` and `Python`. I´ve been working in [First-Step](https://github.com/NicolasHinestroza/First-Step) , a `Django` 
project that I have with some colleagues. 

I'm a math lover, but being aware that we can´t divide our human state, from our logical one, I´m also interested in looking ways to 
link social sciences with hardware and software development, I would like studying Sociology or Anthropology too.

You can reach me writing an email to `jarangoba@unal.edu.co`.

Best Regards... `Jorge Arango`
