# About Me

Hi, my name is Jorge Arango `@El-Jorgex-Pa`, I´m currently studying `Electronic Engineering` at the `National University of Colombia`
while learning `Java` and `Python`. I´ve been working in [First-Step](https://firststep.onrender.com/) , a `Django` 
project that I have with some colleagues. 

I'm a math lover, but I´m also aware that we can´t divide our human condition from our mathematical-logical one, I´m interested in looking ways to 
link social sciences with hardware and software development, I would like studying Sociology or Anthropology too.

# Engineering... For What?

The purpose of an engineer (and not only of an engineer) should not be the one of accumulate wealth for themselves or for a millionaire, by contrast, this labour
should have a positive impact on the society, we can´t just rely social issues to government or other institutions, we are also being part of the problem.
That leads to a important question: `Shall we stop economic development and get focused on fundamental problems as malnutrition?`.

+ There are some areas, like health area, that need the development of stuff to enhance people life´s quality, for that, we couldn´t
  just stop.
+ More necessary, is to stop or slow down the engineering development in areas that only focus on money itself

But we get in troubles when we try to change those paradigms, because we have developed a system in which money is equal to power.
Is more realistic to think that we can manage this system, than changing it ;) . I must remind you this:

`They have the money, we have the ideas, they need us, we know how to do it`

> Bills are a bunch of numbers, paper, and ideals; people are the representation of life itself

You can reach me writing an email to `jarangoba@unal.edu.co` and we can talk about whatever.

Best Regards... `Jorge Arango`
